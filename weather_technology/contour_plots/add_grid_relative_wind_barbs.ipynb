    "\n",
    "Unlike observation data, wind components can be stored in two different ways: 1) Earth relative or 2) grid relative. The most common way for the wind components to be stored would be as Earth relative, meaning that the winds are stored in what would be considered the \"common\" way on a rectilinear grid and would be comparable tp standard observation data. Grid-relative means that the compnents are stored relative to a particular grid projection. Currently the two datasets that have wind components often stored in this grid-relative manner are the North American Model (NAM) and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), whose grid was based off of a historic NAM grid. However, they may not always be stored that way, so you should ALWAYS pay close attention to the meta data associated with your dataset and ensuring the plotted winds conform to known meteorological relationships (e.g., geostrophic/gradient wind balance).\n",
